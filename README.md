# PortFolioWevApplication
This Portfolio Web Application is designed to showcase personal or professional work and achievements in a dynamic, visually appealing way. Built using Java and technologies like Servlets and JSP, the app handles server-side logic and dynamic content generation. The Servlets manage client requests, execute business logic, and interact with the MySQL database for storing portfolio items, project details, and user information. JSP is used to display the content on the front-end, creating a responsive and interactive user interface. The app is structured using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, ensuring clean separation between the controller (Servlets), view (JSP), and data layer (Java classes interacting with the database). you can see through http://localhost:8080/myportfolio
