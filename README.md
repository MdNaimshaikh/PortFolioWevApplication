# PortFolioWevApplication
This project is a dynamic web application built using Java, leveraging Servlets and JSP (JavaServer Pages) for handling server-side logic and rendering dynamic content. Servlets process client requests, execute business logic, and interact with databases, while JSP is used for displaying the user interface, providing a seamless and interactive experience. The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, where Servlets handle the controller logic, JSP serves as the view, and Java classes manage the model/data layer. you can see through http://localhost:8080/myportfolio/
